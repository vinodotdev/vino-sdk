# vino-packet

The Vino packet crate contains the consistent message structure for arbitrary output
from Vino components and providers.

Components output versioned payloads (e.g. a [v0::Payload]) which then get
wrapped into a [Packet] to normalize differences across versions.

[Packet]s are designed for backwards compatibility but that compatibility layer is
strictly between the component and [Packet], not for consumers of the [Packet].
[Packet]s are not meant to be long lived and you should have a compatibility layer
between [Packet]s and your system if you depend on this crate. For example, Vino
uses [vino-transport](https://crates.io/crates/vino-transport) to keep
a dependent platform insulated from [Packet] changes.
