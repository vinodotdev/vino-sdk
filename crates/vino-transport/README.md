# vino-transport

Vino Transport contains the structures and methods for communicating
across entity boundaries. It handles abstracting payload versions and
implementations so they can be used easily.

The `MessageTransport` struct normalizes `vino_packet::Packet`s for
the Vino tools.

The `TransportWrapper` wraps a `MessageTransport` along with the port name
it originated from.

A `TransportStream` is a stream of `TransportWrapper`s.
